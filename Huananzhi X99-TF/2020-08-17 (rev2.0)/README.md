### Huananzhi X99-TF
###BIOS 2020/08/17 (G3X99904)
Another BIOS, based on which Huananzhi continues to release new versions.

As before, the Command Rate (CR) timing can take any given value from 1 to 3

Known changes compared to version 2020/05/25:

+ Intel Management Engine Interface is disabled, and therefore the amount of hardware reserved RAM is reduced by 73.6 MB
+ The beeper beeps more pleasantly
+ Added voltage readings on the +12V and +5V lines (in Hardware Monitor)
- When using server (ECC) memory, the error correction function is not available (active from BIOS version 2021-12-13)
- No power saving state Package C6 (currently unknown how to fix)
- Removed the option to configure RAM timings (fixed in v001)
- Huananzhi engineers made a mistake in the DevicePathDxe module (fixed in v004)
